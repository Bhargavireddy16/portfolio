# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and experience in full-stack development.

I created this project as a creative solution after losing access to my LinkedIn account due to security issues. Instead of just waiting, I decided to build a platform that demonstrates my capabilities directly.

The design mimics the professional look and feel of a LinkedIn profile, highlighting my frontend engineering skills while serving as a central hub for my professional identity.
